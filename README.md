# **Case Study: Palantir Technologies Inc.**
### By: Kyle Kerner

Incorporated in 2003, [Palantir Technologies Inc](<https://www.palantir.com/>) ([NYSE: PLTR](<https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:PLTR>)), was founded by Peter Thiel (Chairman), Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen (President), and Alex Karp (CEO).

Palantir's founding mission was "to help intelligence agencies make better use of their data securely and responsibly".  Preceding the events of September 11th, 2001, the importance data security and the threats of terrorism highly influenced the business and political environments of the United States and world.  

Initially funded solely by Peter Thiel, one of the founders, and successful entrepreneurs who also founded PayPal.  Later due to the security nature of their business, "Palantir was rescued by a referral to In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture arm, which would make two rounds of investment totaling more than $2 million".  According to tracxn.com, through multiple subsequent rounds of financing, Palantir, raised over $3.02B prior to public September 30th, 2020.  

The business of Palantir has been expanding since it was founded.  Initially focusing specially within the intelligence sector, Palantir, has begun expanding the services they provide to a wider customer outside of intelligence companies.

Selling their services of building software for companies that solves problems through data and technology transformation.  These clients are heavily focused and related to the Big Data Analytics category.  According to statista.com, "the global big data analytics market was valued at over 240 billion U.S. dollars in 2021", further, according to 6sense.com, Palantir's, market share is estimated to be 1.97% of the Big Data Analytics industry.

Palantir is unique in the sense that they develop specialized software for their clients.  
> In a *LinkedIn* article written by Chul Choi of Seeking Alpha, he alluded to the fact that "Palantir's software is also difficult to switch to, which gives the company a competitive advantage.  Once an organization has invested in Palantir's software, it is difficult and costly to switch to a different platform.  The gives Palantir a strong incentive to keep its customers happy".

Due to their tailored software each product is specific to each respective client. Using their Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), Palantir is able to leverage data from multiple business sources and LLMs to produce valuable insights that can be used for business decisions.  In 2022, Edge AI, "Palantir's AI orchestration and sensor fusion engine that enables autonomous decision-making across edge devices and environments" was introduced.  Through three stages, collect, learn, and act, Palantir is enabling "autonomous decision-making for models consuming real-time sensor data, including video, images, radar, acoustic, radio data, and more".

Within the Big Data Analytics field, competition is fierce, with a lot of companies providing services in the market.  Palantir competitors include but are not limited to the following: Apache, Databrinks, Alteryx, Tableau, Snowflake, and many others. Palantir, like many of its competitors are leveraging the use of Artificial Intelligence to automate and transform data to fund value and increase efficiency of companies. According to TechTarget Contributor, companies in the industry are trending in the following four ways:

>
    1.) Generative AI, advanced analytics and machine learning continue to evolve
    2.) More data, increased data diversity drive advances in processing and the rise of edge computing
    3.) Big data storage needs spur innovations in cloud and hybrid cloud platforms, growth of data lakes
    4.) DataOps and data stewardship move to the fore
>

Recently, with the mass success of AI in the world, Palantir has been able to grow revenues significantly "report[ing] that revenue in the [fourth] quarter increased 20%".  Heavily impacting the government sector, revenues and earnings per share are key indicators of the success of companies.  Due to Palantir's uniqueness within the industry their performance has been great partnered with the current AI-boom, however, analysts and other investors question whether the Big Data Analytics business services that Palantir provides is sustainable.  This brings to question whether Palantir's uniqueness advantage can keep up with the stable recurring revenue and performance of some of its competitors. 

Reflecting on Palantir's history and future outlook, I would encourage them to focus on driving success for the clients that they produce software for.  Success can be enhanced by partnering with other industry providers or expanding their services to include more expansive industry data by leveraging the data that they have access to.  This offering will help to build customer loyalty and industry recognition as a superior service provider that can help to alleviate concerns for recurring revenue.  Albeit, this approach is focused towards expanding services outside of government related companies. 

Another approach would be to advise Palantir to focus specifically on government related security organizations.  A lot of the success is driven by the ability of society to adopt a more transparent acceptance of data sharing.  If companies and people can push their meter of allowing the data they produce can be utilized wholistically to improve the efficiency of society.  One idea that comes to mind is the intelligence gathering supercomputer, in the movie *Eagle Eye*. 

Overall, I believe Palantir is a valuable company that is offering superior services to the market.  If they can adapt correctly and continue to deliver a superior product to their customers I can see them becoming a meaningful contributor to the AI Big Data Analytics and business service provider industries for the forseeable future.
